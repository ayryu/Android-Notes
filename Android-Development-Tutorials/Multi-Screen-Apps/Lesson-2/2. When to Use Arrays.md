### 2. When to Use Arrays

For each of the CategoryActivities, we want to be able to display the list of numbers on the app screen.
We can hold these values in an **array**. It will store a list of variables and maintain the order. 
An array is like a container with a fixed length - once it's been created, the array will stay the length in which it was created. Once we create the array, all the values have to be the same type.
Each element can hold a single value

*Deciding how to store your data is known as choosing the right * **data structures** for your app.  
You can store instances with primitive data types (int, long, float, etc.) and Object data types (String, TextView, Buttons, etc.)

### 3. Working with an Array

Example code:

```java
//Creating the array
int [] shoeSizesAvailable = new int[3];
```
The number found between the square brackets is the length of the array, however in Java, arrays are zero-indexed.

```java
//Initialize elements in an array
shoeSizesAvailable[0] = 5;
shoeSizesAvailable[1] = 7;
shoeSizesAvailable[2] = 10;
```
So we have assigned numbers to each of the index slots of the array. 

```java
//Accessing elements in an array
system.out.println(shoeSizesAvailable[0]); // prints 5
system.out.println(shoeSizesAvailable[1]); // prints 7
system.out.println(shoeSizesAvailable[2]); // prints 10
```

At each of these index positions, these are the associated values held in positions

```java
//Get the array length
system.out.println(shoeSizesAvailable.length); // outputs 3
```

We're adding an array to hold a list of numbers. The method will be placed at the end of the onCreate method found in each of the category Activities.
