### 12. Use the `for` loop

We tend to use `while` loops when we want to repeat a task until something happens where the condition is no longer true. `while` loops can have an indefinite number of iterations.
A real world example is to keep opening all files in a particular folder **while** there are still files to be opened. We don't care about how many files in that folder there are, we just keep opening them while files are present.
We tend to use `for` loops when we want to repeat a task a specific number of times. So an example of a `for` loop is to open the first five files in a folder. Even if there are files left in that folder, we only want to open the specified amount.
 
The following are some coding examples of the `while` loop vs. the `for` loop.

Both blocks of code produce the same output; they print a log statement for each element of the words list. 

The equivalent of setting up a counter variable in a `while` loop is known as an **initialization statement** in regards to the `for` loop. It will only be executed once - before the loop starts.
In the `for` loop, the condition also determines how many iterations occur. The loops continue until the condition is `false`. 
The update counter variable of the `for` loop will update *after* each iteration of the loop. This means we execute all of the code in the block, and then run the update statement, then check the test condition to determine if another iteration occurs.
