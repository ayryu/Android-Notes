### 11. Add TextViews to Layout with `while` loop

Let's learn about `while` loops. `while` is a Java keyword. It means that we keep executing a block of statements as long as a certain condition is `true`. 
After all the lines of code within the body have been run through, the loop checks again to see if the condition is `true`. If so, we run the instructions within the braces again. 
If the condition is `false`, we exit the loop and run the code that comes after the loop.

The condition *determines how many times the code inisde the `while` block will be executed. One use case involves the condition testing the state of a variable. 
 So we can set up a counter variable before we begin the loop. At the end of each iteration, we update the counter variable. And at some point, the variable is going to update such that the condition will be false, and that results in exiting the loop.

The following is an example of a `while` loop in action:

In general, there are 3 questions we can ask ourselves to determine whether it's appropriate to write a `while` loop.
Q1. What task are we trying to accomplish?
Q2. To figure out the condition we ask, how many times do we need to repeat the loop?
Q3. And as a result, what is the condition of the loop?

A1. We want to play a sound.
A2. 3 times. 
A3. The count variable must be less than 3 - while(count < 3) (assuming count starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration).
