### 19. ListView and ArrayAdapter Quiz

Using a generic class like `ArrayList<E>` is better than having a class for every single data type. 


`ArrayAdapter` is also a generic class: `ArrayAdapter<T>` indicated by the angle brackets. T is a type parameter like E that can be swapped out for a specific data object type. 
T specifically stands for Data Type because we need to say what types of data are in the array and in our case specifically, we have an array of data type strings.


We can see below how `ArrayAdapter` is used based off of the inheritance it follows:


The adapter knows about the data source whether it's an array or a list. And it knows how to present each of these items as a view.

Meanwhile, the ListView handles showing these views on screen, detecting the user's touch gestures and maintaining state on where the user is within the entire list.
You can think of the ListView and Adapter as User Interface and Data Model respectively, although it's not a clean separation because the `ArrayAdapter` deals with the views but primarily the `ListView` is in charge of the details of the user interface. 
So you can use a `GridView` instead of a `ListView` or a drop-down menu (officially known as a **spinner**).
