### 21. Build List Item Layout

When we made an instance of the `ArrayAdapter`, the layout we used as an input parameter (android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1) is a layout provided by the Android framework.
```java
ArrayAdapter<String> itemsAdapter = 
        new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, words);
```

To see a list of all the layouts in the Android framework, check out the R.layout page in the Android developer's guide.
In the case of `android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1`, it only contains one TextView.
 We need a list item that has more than one TextView because we are going to be displaying English AND Miwok words.

 So we're going to build our own layout with two TextViews, and assign View IDs to the TextViews because we will be referring to these Views later in the Java code.
