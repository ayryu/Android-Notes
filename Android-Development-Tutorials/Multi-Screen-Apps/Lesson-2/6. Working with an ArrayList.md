### 6. Working with an `ArrayList`

Here's one of the limitations to arrays. Once the array has been created, it is stuck at the size which it was set to. 
With ArrayLists, you can add or remove elements at will. However, you can't put everything in an element of an `ArrayList`. ArrayLists can only hold Object data types. 
If you did want to put in something like an integer, in Java you would use something called **Object wrappers**. They wrap around primitive data types to help them become Object data types. 

So we can store `ArrayList<Integer>`, but it cannot store `ArrayList<int>`.

Why would you use an array over an `ArrayList`?
Below is a table that compares and contrasts Arrays vs. ArrayLists:

An array is not a class. It doesn't have methods to access and modify elements. 
`ArrayList` has a class definition. This means that every instance of an `ArrayList` is an object which has methods we can use to access and modify the data. 
An array can hold primitive data types and Object data types while an `ArrayList` can only hold Objects. 

An example of using an array over an `ArrayList` is when setting your alarm on an app and looking at which days of the week in which the alarm will ring.

The days of the week never change, so you can use a boolean array to set Yes or No (True or False) whether the alarm should ring on Friday for example.
