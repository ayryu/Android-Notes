### 7. Create New Activities

For the Miwok app, instead of sending intents and launching into other apps on the Android device.
Instead, we're sending intents to open other activities that are created within the Miwok App.

We'll be working with 5 activities. The `MainActivity`, as well as one `Activity` for each category of words.
 There will be buttons on `MainActivity` that correspond to each of the word categories
 When we click on a category in `MainActivity`, we'll send an `Intent` to open a new `Activity`.
Each `Activity` will contain a **list**.
