### 6. Read MainActivity.java file

```java
package com.example.android.miwok; //what follows the package keyword is the package name

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // Set the content of the activity to use the activity_main.xml layout file
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}
```

```java
package com.example.android.miwok;
```
The `package` name *uniquely identifies our app* on an Android device
All the code for our app will be grouped together under this `package` name

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
```
`import` statements import Java classes that we didn't write but we can still use in our code
These files belong to other packages of code in the Android framework which was written by the Android team
In the code above, we are importing the `AppCompatActivity` class from the package called `android.support.v7.app`

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
```

This is a class declaration. It declares that this file contains the definition of the class called `MainActivity`.
It extends from a superclass called `AppCompatActivity` which means it inherits all the behaviours that `AppCompatActivity` has.
`MainActivity` inherits showing the window in the device and showing the app bar.
We only modify this class declaration if we want to change the name of the class or change where we're inheriting from.

```java
@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
```

This is a **method Override**. We're overriding the `onCreate` method *that was originally defined in the* `AppCompatActivity` *class*.
This `onCreate` method is called by Android when it first creates an instance of `MainActivity`, so when you open the app on your device.
In this section of code, we're providing our own steps for what to do when the app is created.

```java
        // Set the content of the activity to use the activity_main.xml layout file
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}
```
Inside the `onCreate` method, we have a line that creates the `setContentView` method and passes in the `activity_main` layout as an input argument.
We're telling Android to put the UI defined in the `activity_main` XML file into the `MainActivity` screen
