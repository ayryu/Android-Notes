### 10. Implicit vs. Explicit Intents

Implicit intents are used if you don't know and/or don't care which app or app component will handle the intent.
For example, in a social media app, you can send an intent to allow a user to take a photo. It doesn't matter 
which camera app receives the intent, it's enough that the app has the capability of taking a photo.

What's inside an implicit intent?
- An action to perform
-Data URI (Uniform Resource Identifier - a string that refers to a resource)
-We can also add:
  -Categories
  -Components
  -Extras (extra information)

Example code from Just Java app:
### 10. Implicit vs. Explicit Intents

**Implicit intents** are used *if you don't know and/or don't care which app or app component will handle the intent*.
For example, in a social media app, you can send an intent to allow a user to take a photo. It doesn't matter which camera app receives the intent, it's enough that the app has the capability of taking a photo.

What's inside an **implicit intent**?
1. An action to perform
2. Data URI (Uniform Resource Identifier - a string that refers to a resource)

We can also add:
3. Categories
4. Components
5. Extras (extra information)

Example code from Just Java app:
```java
//Creating a text message with a string
Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO);
sendIntent.setData(Uri.parse("mailto:"));
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA.SUBJECT, "Just Java order for " + name);
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, priceMessage);

//Verify that the intent will resolve properly
if (sendIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) !=null) {
    startActivity(sendIntent);
}
```

**Explicit intents** are used if *you know exactly which app component or activity should handle the intent*. 
You almost never want to use an explicit intent to open a third party app because we don't know if that app is on the device.
In the case of the Miwok app, we want to send an explicit intent to the `NumbersActivity` on our app to open that screen.

What's inside an explicit intent?
1. Context
2. Component (usually a `Class`/`Activity` to which we want to navigate)

Sometimes we can add:
3. Data URI so that Component can receive certain information

Example code:
```java
//Executed in an Activity, so 'this' is the Context
Intent intent = new Intent(this, NumbersActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
```

Similarities:
1. We *create object instances* of the `Intent` class, and then we *pass that intent as an argument* in the startActivity method.
2. Both intents are capable of handling intent extras. It just so happens in this example that only the implicit intent has extras.

Differences:
1. The constructors take different inputs.
  -Implicit intents take action strings such as ACTION_VIEW or ACTION_SEND to announce what generic action the app needs.
  -Explicit intents can directly name the class component they need to open. 
2. Implicit intents use an if block around the resolveActivity method, which catches cases where there aren't any apps in the device to handle the intent request.

By specifying an intent filter in the AndroidManifest file, apps announce which intents they can receive and handle.
