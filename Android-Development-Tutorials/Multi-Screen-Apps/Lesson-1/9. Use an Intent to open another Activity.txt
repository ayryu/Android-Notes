### 9. Use an Intent to open another `Activity`

These are the steps on how to open a new `Activity` when a category in the `MainActivity` is clicked on:
1. We need to know when a user clicks on a certain category.
2. We need to send an `Intent` to open an `Activity` within our app.

We're going to make each of the categories buttons.

In the `activity_main` XML file, we're going to be adding the `onClick` attribute to each of the TextViews.
For example:
```xml
<TextView
android:onClick="openNumbersList"/>
```

The above code tells Android to open the method openNumbersList when the TextView gets clicked.
Now, we are going to create the openNumbersList method.
Check out the documentation for the [android:onClick attribute] (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#attr_android:onClick) to learn how to define the openNumbersList method.
This [Vogella article] (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#attr_android:onClick) provides a fuller description of intents.

To start an activity, use the method `startActivity(intent)`. This method is defined on the `Context` object which `Activity` extends.
```java
//Start the activity connect to the specified class

Intent i = new Intent(this, ActivityTwo.class);
startActivity(i);
```

Activities which are started by other Android activities are called **sub-activities**.
